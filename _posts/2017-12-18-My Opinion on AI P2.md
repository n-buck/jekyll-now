title: My Opinion revisited

My opinion half a year later
---------
All in all, my opinion has not changed much. I still don't believe in a general-purpose-AI, with own personality and so on. AI is more about finding an efficient way to a given goal, than creating self-concious beings.
Still, there were some thought-provoking impulses. Not just during the lecture, where we implemented our own "Rasterfahndung", but also the recent events in china. There is pervasive surveillance. Not only all your internet traffic is watched, but also your public occurrence is judged by computers [here's a link](https://www.golem.de/news/china-die-aaa-buerger-1712-131477.html)
That is kind of scary!
