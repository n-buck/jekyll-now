title: My Opinion revisited
---

My opinion half a year later
---------
All in all, my opinion has not changed much. I still don't believe in a general-purpose-AI, with own personality and so on. AI is more about finding an efficient way to a given goal, than creating self-concious beings.
Still, there were some thought-provoking impulses. Not just during the lecture, where we implemented our own "Rasterfahndung", but also the recent events in china. There is pervasive surveillance. Not only all your internet traffic is watched, but also your public occurrence is judged by computers [here's a link](https://www.golem.de/news/china-die-aaa-buerger-1712-131477.html)
That is kind of scary!

##About the second blog post

Here s [the link](http://rodneybrooks.com/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-predicting-the-future-of-ai/)
This opinion is much closer to mine. Specially the part with the job-replacement through machines. Just because we can produce more with less effort, it does not mean we have to work less! And during this semester we haven't heard anything close to an AGI. In chapter B he mentions a techno god, this is one of the most absurd parts in the blog post we reviewed to begin this semester. To find it here again approves that this wasn't a joke.
In chapter C, he criticizes the author of the cite:

>The well-known example of paper clips is a case in point: if the machineâ€™s only goal is maximizing the number of paper clips, it may invent incredible technologies as it sets about converting all available mass in the reachable universe into paper clips; but its decisions are still just plain dumb.

Maybe, he s just criticising him because he doesn't know the game?
To D:
Here he talks about the movie-like AI-dangers and declares all of them as stupid and exaggerated. As I already mentioned in the introduction, I think there is a little bit more to it. In china are already cameras who judge your behavior. I suppose to make an androidal cop is feasible. So the scenario where sleeping androids are watching over a city, and going to awaken when something happens is not that impossible to me.
